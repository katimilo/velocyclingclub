        <p>Join the club for fun on bikes. It’s chill, friendly and supportive.
          <br>There’s no pressure to race but lots of encouragement if you’re up for it.
          <br>We’ll give you as much advice and info as we can, whatever you want to try.
          <br>Plus, plenty of shits’n’giggles to be had in our skills sessions (although we’re serious about improving
          skills, speed and confidence!)

        <h2>Crit.</h2>
        <p>We take part in many crit races all over the world.
          <br>Be it something famous like Red Hook Crit or something small and local like Crystal Palace Criterium.</p>

        <h2>Track.</h2>
        <p id='track'>Track cycling is loads of fun – and it’s much more accessible than you might think.
          <br>Even if you don’t fancy racing (yet!), it’s amazing for building your fitness and skills.
          <br>Inspirational much?</p>

        <h2>Cyclocross.</h2>
        <p>Cyclocross is one of the easiest forms of cycle racing to get involved in and arguably the most fun,
          <br>especially if you’ve never done any form of competitive cycling before.
          <br>We have a large representation from Velo Cycling taking part in training and racing throughout the season.
